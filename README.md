This notebook solves the Dirac equation in an electric field, E(t,x), E(t,x,y) or E(t,x,y,z), and computes the probability of Schwinger pair production, using the method is described in:

The code has been tested on Colab with 3 different runtime types: CPU for 1+1, T4 GPU for 2+1, and A100 GPU for 3+1.
