jaxSchwingerGH.ipynb is an updated code which is much faster.  


This notebook solves the Dirac equation in an electric field, E(t,x), E(t,x,y) or E(t,x,y,z), and computes the probability of Schwinger pair production, using the method described in:

G. Torgrimsson,
``Momentum correlation in pair production by spacetime dependent fields from scattered wave functions''
arXiv:2509.17770

The code has been tested on Colab with 3 different runtime types: CPU for 1+1, T4 GPU for 2+1, and A100 GPU for 3+1.
